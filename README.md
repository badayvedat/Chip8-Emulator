## Chip8-Emulator
A simple CHIP-8 Emulator/Interpreter written in C++. Also SDL2 used for Graphics and SDL2_Mixer for Sound.

## Overview
This is a hobby project I started to dive into world of emulation and learn about how they work in most basic way.

In the world of emulation a CHIP-8 Emulator is equivelant of "Hello, World" in the world of programming.

## Building
For now it only can be built in Windows using Visual Studio.
  #### Windows
   Visual Studio users can clone repo and open solution file.


For those who do not want to build I included precompiled binary files in /build folder.

## Usage 
Before running emulator be sure to check config.ini file.
After that you can just run it by clicking executable file.
